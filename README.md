# GradeAssist
Mobile Application Development Group Project Spring 2020

GradeAssist is an application for teachers to review students' results on quizzes given in class.
At a basic level, we will pull JSON from a quiz and return each question along with the percentage of students
per answer. UI will be easy and simple to read, so the teacher can quickly get a high-level understanding
of how the class did on the quiz.
